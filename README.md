# Amazon Reviews of Alexa Products Analysis

## Project Overview
Amazon sells various products of their own on their website. One of the set of products that Amazon is well-known for selling are its Amazon Alexa products, which are products that have a built-in virtual assistant AI named Alexa. What do customers think about these products? In this project, I'll be analyzing a dataset containing customer reviews over the span of 3 months from over 3,000 customers to see how customers feel about these Alexa products.
